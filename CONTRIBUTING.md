## Getting started with Fider codebase

Before start working on something that you intend to send a Pull Request, make sure there's an [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/getfider/fider/issues) open for that. If you're working on something not tracked yet, please open a new Issue before the Pull Request. If you have any question or need any help, leave a comment on the issue and we'll try our best to help you.

Fider is written in Go (backend) and TypeScript (frontend), but we also use things like Node.js, React and PostgreSQL.
If you know these technologies or would like to learn them, lucky you! This is the right place!

Install the following tools:

- Go 1.10+ (https://golang.org/)
- Node.js 10+ (https://nodejs.org/)
- Docker (https://www.docker.com/)

We also use the following Go CLI tools, so install them using `go get <url>`:

- cosmtrek/air (https://github.com/cosmtrek/air/)
- joho/godotenv (https://github.com/joho/godotenv/)
- magefile/mage (https://github.com/magefile/mage/)

To setup your development workspace:

1) clone the repository into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/getfider/fider`
2) run `npm install` to install front end packages 
3) run `docker-compose up -d pgdev` to start a local PostgreSQL database on Docker.
4) run `cp .example.env .env` to create a local environment configuration file.
5) run `mage watch` to start the application.
6) Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` and ðŸŽ‰! You should see the sign up page of Fider!

To run the unit tests:

1) run `docker-compose up -d pgtest` to start a test-only PostgreSQL database on Docker.
2) run `mage test`.

**NOTE:** It's currently not possible to build and develop Fider on **Windows**, if you're a Windows user and want to contribute to Fider, please help us resolve this [issue](https://github.com/getfider/fider/issues/434) first.
