# Want to contribute?

[Feedback for Fider](https://feedback.fider.io/) is the entry point for any new feature request. We use our own platform for users to share and vote on what they would like to see implemented on Fider.

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/getfider/fider/issues) is created for every **accepted feature request**, **technical request** or **bugs**. Every issue should briefly describes what's the work involved and it'll be used to track progress on its development.

We have a monthly [GitHub Milestone](https://github.com/getfider/fider/milestones) that lists everything that is due to be released on that month.
