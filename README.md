If you know these technologies or would like to learn them, lucky you! This is the right place!

Tools you'll need:

- Go 1.8+ (https://golang.org)
- Node.js 6+ (https://nodejs.org/)
- Docker (https://www.docker.com/)

Step by step:

1) clone this repository into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/getfider/fider`
2) run `npm install` to install front end packages 
3) run `npm run build:watch` to pack the front end source into a bundle. It'll 
4) run `docker-compose up -d pgdev` to start a local PostgreSQL database on Docker.
